.SYNOPSIS
Compares code coverage percent of local coverage.xml file to dev branch
(Azure Pipeline API).

.PARAMETER wd
The working directory in which to search for current coverage.xml.

.PARAMETER org
Name of the Azure DevOps organization where the pipeline is hosted.

.PARAMETER project
Name of the Azure DevOps project to which the pipeline belongs.

.PARAMETER pipeline_name
Name of the desired pipeline within the project. This is to support projects
with multiple pipelines.
