# {{ sitename }} website

Code for site at: http://{{ domain }}


## Getting started

Make sure Python 3.5 or higher is installed on your system.
Open this directory in a command prompt, then:

1. Install the software, and the dev tooling:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

2. Build the Sass:
   ```
   python manage.py sass -g website/static/website/src/custom.scss website/static/website/css/
   ```

   To build the Sass automatically whenever you change a file, add the `--watch`
   option and run it in a separate terminal. To build a compressed/minified
   production version, add the `-t compressed` option. For more options, see
   [django-sass](https://github.com/coderedcorp/django-sass/).

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

4. Go to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser, or http://localhost:8000/admin/
   to log in and get to work!
