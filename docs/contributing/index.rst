Developing CodeRed CMS
---------------------------------

To create a test project locally:

#. Clone the code from https://github.com/coderedcorp/coderedcms.
#. Run ``pip install -e ./[dev]`` from the root coderedcms directory. The -e flag makes the install editable,
   which is relevant when running ``makemigrations`` in test project to actually generate the migration
   files in the coderedcms pip package. The ``[dev]`` installs extras such as sphinx for generating docs.
#. Follow the steps in :doc:`/getting_started/install`. Use ``testproject`` for
   your project name to ensure it is ignored by git.
#. When making model or block changes within coderedcms, run ``makemigrations coderedcms`` in the
   test project to generate the relevant migration files for the pip package. ALWAYS follow steps
   4 and 5 in :doc:`/getting_started/install` with a fresh database before making migrations.
#. When model or block changes affect the local test project (i.e. the "website" app), run
   ``makemigrations website`` in the test project to generate the relevant migration files locally.
   Apply and test the migrations. When satisfied, re-generate the 0001_initial.py migration in
   ``project_template/website/migrations/`` as so:

       #. Create a new test project using ``coderedcms start testproject``.
       #. Before running migrations, DELETE all migrations in ``testproject/website/migrations/``.
       #. Run ``python manage.py makemigrations website``. This should generate an ``0001_initial.py``
          migration.
       #. Replace ``project_template/website/migrations/0001_initial.py`` with your newly generated migration.

When making changes that are potentially destructive or backwards incompatible, increment the minor
version number until coderedcms reaches a stable 1.0 release. Each production project that uses
coderedcms should specify the appropriate version in its requirements.txt to prevent breakage.

.. note:
    When testing existing projects with coderedcms installed from the master or development branches,
    be sure to use a disposable database, as it is likely that the migrations in master will
    not be the same migrations that get released.


CSS Development
---------------

When CSS changes are needed for front-end code (not the wagtail admin), Sass should be used.
Each block, page, snippet, or other component that requires styling should have a dedicated ``.scss``
file created beginning with an underscore in ``coderedcms/static/scss/``. Then import the file
in our main ``codered-front.scss`` file. Then build a human readable and minified version of CSS
from the command prompt as so:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd coderedcms/static/coderedcms/

    // Build human readable CSS, and source map for nicer debugging.
    $ pysassc -g -t expanded scss/codered-front.scss css/codered-front.css

    // Build minified CSS.
    $ pysassc -t compressed scss/codered-front.scss css/codered-front.min.css

Finally, copy the license header comment into codered-front.min.css (since ``pysassc`` does
not have an argument to preserve comments while also using compressed output).

The generated CSS files must also be committed to version control whenever a sass file is
changed, as they are distributed as part of our package.


JavaScript Development
----------------------

All JavaScript should use ``codered-front.js`` as an entry point, meaning feature
detection should happen in ``codered-front.js`` and then only load secondary scripts and CSS
as needed. This ensures only one single small JavaScript file is required on page load, which
reduces render-blocking resources and page load time.

All JavaScript files produced by CodeRed should contain a license header comment. This standard
license header comment states copyright, ownership, license, and also provides compatibility for
`LibreJS <https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/free-your-javascript.html>`_.

Testing CodeRed CMS
-------------------

To run the built in tests for CodeRed CMS using Django, run the following:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python testproject/manage.py test coderedcms --settings=coderedcms.tests.settings

Or, to use ``pytest`` and output a unit test report and code coverage report (this how CI runs the tests):

.. code-block:: console

    $ pytest coderedcms/ --ds=coderedcms.tests.settings --junitxml=junit/test-results.xml --cov=coderedcms --cov-report=xml --cov-report=html

Detailed test coverage reports are now available by opening ``htmlcov/index.html`` in your browser (which is ignored by version control)


Adding New Tests
----------------

Test coverage at the moment is fairly minimal and it is highly recommended that new features and models include proper unit tests.
Any testing infrastructure (i.e. implementations of abstract models and migrations) needed should be added to the ``tests`` app in your
local copy of CodeRed CMS.  The tests themselves should be in their relevant section in CodeRed CMS (i.e. tests for
models in ``coderedcms.models.page_models`` should be located in ``coderedcms.models.tests.test_page_models``).

For example, here is how you would add tests for a new abstract page type, ``CoderedCustomPage`` that would live in ``coderedcms/models/page_models.py``:

1. Navigate to ``coderedcms/tests/testapp/models.py``
2. Add the following import: ``from coderedcms.models.page_models import CoderedCustomPage``
3. Implement a concrete version of ``CoderedCustomPage``, i.e. ``CustomPage(CoderedCustomPage)``.
4. Run ``python manage.py makemigrations`` to make new testing migrations.
5. Navigate to ``coderedcms/models/tests/test_page_models.py``
6. Add the following import: ``from coderedcms.models import CoderedCustomPage``
7. Add the following import: ``from coderedcms.tests.testapp.models import CustomPage``
8. Add the following to the bottom of the file:

.. code-block:: python

    class CoderedCustomPageTestCase(AbstractPageTestCase, WagtailPageTests):
        model = CoderedCustomPage

9. Add the following to the bottom of the file:

.. code-block:: python

    class CustomPageTestCase(ConcreteBasicPageTestCase, WagtailPageTests):
        model = CustomPage

10. Write any specific test cases that ``CoderedCustomPage`` and ``CustomPage`` may require.

Building pip packages
---------------------

To build a publicly consumable pip package, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel


Building documentation
----------------------

For every code or feature change, be sure to update the docs in the repository. To build and publish
the documentation run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd docs/
    $ make clean
    $ make html

Output will be in ``docs/_build/html/`` directory.


Publishing a new release
------------------------

First checkout the code/branch for release.

Next build a pip package:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

Then upload the pip package to the Python Package Index:

.. code-block:: console

    $ twine upload dist/*

Finally build and update docs:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd docs/
    $ make clean
    $ make html

If updating docs for an existing minor version release:

#. Copy the contents of ``docs/_build/html/`` to the CodeRed docs server under the existing version directory.

If this is a new major or minor version release:

#. Create a new ``major.minor`` directory on the CodeRed docs server.
#. Update the ``stable`` symbolic link to point to the new version directory.
#. Add the new version to the ``versions.txt`` file on the docs server.
#. Copy the contents of ``docs/_build/html/`` to the CodeRed docs server under the new version directory.

Note that we do not release separate documentation versions for maintenance releases. Update the existing minor
version docs with release notes and other changes.
