* **Page link** - Reference a page within the CMS.

* **Document link** If a Page is not selected, reference a Document within the
  CMS

* **Other link** - If a Page or Document is not selected, the value of this
  field will be used as-is. If a Page is selected, then the value of this field
  will be appended to the Page URL. This is useful for linking to fragments or
  element IDs. For example: Page ``/about/`` with Other link ``#team`` would
  then link to ``/about/#team``.
