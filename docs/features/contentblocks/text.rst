Text Block

The text block allows the user to create formatted text with headers, lists, links, and media.
This is one of the most versatile editors.  It's best to try out all the options to get a feel for what all it can do.

* H2, H3, H4 -- titles and subtitles

* numbered list or bullet list

* horizontal line or line break

* embed, link, document, or image -- media content that can be embedded in the block
