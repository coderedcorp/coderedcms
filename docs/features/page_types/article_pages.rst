Article Pages
=============

Create a blog

Usage
-----

First start by creating an "Article Landing Page" and then add any number of
"Article Page"s as children of the "Article Landing Page". Each child page here
represents an individual article. Add content to these pages as you would for a
normal "Web Page".
