Design Philosophy
-----------------

Pages for your CodeRed CMS site use a "Parent-Child" relationship.  A parent page is any page that is an ancestor of other pages in the site's tree structure.  A child page is any page that is a descendant of another page in the site's tree structure.  A lot of specific site functionality is broken up into these "Parent-Child" relationships.  For example, if you want to add a blog to your site, you would add an "Article Landing Page", which would have your "Article Page"s as descendants.  

.. note::
    
    | A site's page struture could look like the following:

        Home Page -> Article Landing Page -> Article Page
    
    In this example, Home Page is a direct ancestor/parent of Article Landing Page.  Article Landing Page is a direct descendant/child of Home Page.  Article Landing Page is also a direct ancestor/parent of Article Page.  Article Page is a direct descendant/child of Article Landing Page.

Below is a table of the current possible "Parent-Child" relationships.

===================== ====================================================================================
Parent Page Type      Child Page Types
===================== ====================================================================================
Web Page              Web Page, Article Landing Page, Event Landing Page, Location Landing Page, Form Page
Article Landing Page  Article Page
Event Landing Page    Event Page
Location Landing Page Location Page
===================== ====================================================================================

To add a new child page to any existing page, navigate to that page in the admin and click on the "Add Child Page" button.

Development Philosophy
----------------------

When it comes to pages on the site, we strive to keep all the core functionality in Abstract models.  When you create a new CodeRed CMS project, your generated app will come pre-loaded with Concrete implementations of some of these Abstract models.  These concrete models are yours to modify as needed.  But do be advised that changing built in functionality could have untested consequences.  By keeping the core page functionality abstract, migrations are easier to deal with on a per project basis.
