Location Pages
===================

Create location pages for individual locations. These could be stores, distributors, facilities, etc. Placing these location pages under a location landing page aggregates them using an interactive Google Map.

Usage
-----

First start by creating a "Location Landing Page" and then add any number of "Location Page"s as children of the "Location Landing Page". Each child page here represents a location that will have its own page and show up in its parent Google map.  Add content to this page as you would for a normal Web Page.

Location Landing Page
---------------------

Layout Tab
~~~~~~~~~~

* **Center Latitude**: The latitude you want the Google map to center on.
* **Center Longitude**: The longitude you want the Google map to center on.
* **Zoom**: The zoom level you want the Google map to default to.  This requires an API key to use zoom. The zoom values can be between 1-20.  1: World, 5: Landmass continent, 10: City, 15: Streets, 20: Buildings

Next, save the Location Landing Page. Now create a child "Location Page" under your new "Location Landing Page". 


Location Page

Content Tab
~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Address**: The address of the location.
* **Website**: The website for the location, if applicable.
* **Phone Number**: The phone number of the location, if applicable.

Layout Tab
~~~~~~~~~~

* **Map Title**: A custom title that will be used for this location's Google map pin.  It will default to the page's normal title if not provided.
* **Map Description**: A custom description that will be used for this location's Google map pin.

Settings Tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Auto Update Latitude and Longitude**: If checked, the latitude and longitude will be calculated whenever the page is saved based off of the provided address.
* **Latitude**: The latitude that you want this location's Google map pin to be set as.
* **Longitude**: The longitude that you want this location's Google map pin to be set as.


Implementation
--------------

The store locator is built-in to CodeRed CMS but is not enabled by default. To implement, add
the following to your ``website/models.py``::

    from coderedcms.models import CoderedLocationIndexPage, CoderedLocationPage


    class LocationPage(CoderedLocationPage):
        """
        A page that holds a location.  This could be a store, a restaurant, etc.
        """
        class Meta:
            verbose_name = 'Location Page'

        template = 'coderedcms/pages/location_page.html'

        # Only allow LocationIndexPages above this page.
        parent_page_types = ['website.LocationIndexPage']


    class LocationIndexPage(CoderedLocationIndexPage):
        """
        A page that holds a list of locations and displays them with a Google Map.
        This does require a Google Maps API Key that can be defined in Settings > Google API Settings
        """
        class Meta:
            verbose_name = 'Location Landing Page'

        # Override to specify custom index ordering choice/default.
        index_query_pagemodel = 'website.LocationPage'

        # Only allow LocationPages beneath this page.
        subpage_types = ['website.LocationPage']

        template = 'coderedcms/pages/location_index_page.html'

Next run ``python manage.py makemigrations website`` and ``python manage.py migrate`` to create
the new pages in your project.

Now when going to the wagtail admin, you can create a Location Index Page, and child Location Pages.
Also be sure to add a Google Maps API key under Settings > Google API Settings.

.. note::
    Before creating or importing location pages, add your Google API key for automatic geolocation.
