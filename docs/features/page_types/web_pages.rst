Web Pages
===================

The standard page for your website.  All other page types on the site will share the functionality of this page type.

Usage
-----

First start by creating a "Web Page".  Each page on your site will have an assortment of tabs that house different types of data/content for that page.

In the Wagtail admin, we break up all the fields on a page into seperate tabs to help with readability and to group similar functionality together.  Listed below are the available tabs, what they do, and what fields you can expect to be shown in them.
