**Display text**: The text you want to use for the link. This is not necessary if you're using an **Image** as the link.
**Image**: The image you want to use for the link.  This is optional and only really used if you need some special image to be used as the link, something like a paypal donate button.
**Sub-links**: Optional field to determine any dropdown links attached to this link.
