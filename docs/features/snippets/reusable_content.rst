Reusable Content
================

A representation of content that you would like to repeat often on your pages.

Fields
------

**Name**: A unique name for your footer.  It can be anything, it is just used as a personal reference to easily tell them apart.
**Content**: A streamfield that contains the layout blocks for the resusable content.
