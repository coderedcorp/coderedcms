Your First CodeRed Website: Part 3
==================================

Let's begin to work on our navigation and footer setup.

Customizing the navigation
--------------------------

The general layout of your navbar can be found in the **Settings > Layout** 
section of the Wagtail Admin. We previously discussed choosing a dark or 
light navbar and adding Bootstrap classes, but you can also add/remove the
Search bar, set it to fixed (stays at the top even when you scroll) or full-width, 
decide on which screen size it will collapse into a menu hamburger, and whether to
center the logo at the top or keep it toward the left. 

Create your menus
-----------------

Your navbar will have links to your other pages or external content that you want
to share. To build your menu, go to **Snippets > Navigation Bars**. In the top right-
hand corner is a button that says **Add Navigation Bar**. Click on this button to start!
(Alternatively, you can also click on the link that says "Why not add one?")

Name your navbar. In this case, this will be our main navigation bar so we have simply named it
Main Nav. 

There are three types of links that you can add to your navbar. Let's briefly describe each one:

* **Page link with sub-links** - Add links to pages from within your website. Add sub-links for dropdown items.

* **External link with sub-links** - Add external links from other websites to your site, as well as sub-links.

* **Document link with sub-links** - Add document links with sub-links to your navbar. 

We don't have any other pages set up yet, but we can still create our menu. For now, we will just link to
the Home page and update it once we have more pages.
