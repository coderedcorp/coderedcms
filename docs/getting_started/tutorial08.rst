Your First CodeRed Website: Part 8
==================================

Let's do a brief lesson on SEO. This is important because it determines how search engines
rank and index your site on the web. You should consider SEO when you make your website, so 
that is why we want to cover it here. 

What is SEO?
------------

SEO stands for **Search Engine Optimization**. Basically, you want to optimize searching for your website.
While the algorithms for search engines like Google tend to remain mysterious, one of the ways that search engines
index your site for people to find it is through the use of **keywords**. 

Before you can begin working on the SEO for your site, you need to know what your site is about and who would benefit
from finding it. What kinds of questions would those potential customers or website visitors ask a search engine? Take the
time to write down these questions. 

Next, pinpoint the keywords that are in your search questions. For our Simple Sweets Desserts company, keywords might begin
words like: cupcakes, cakes, bakery, cookies, desserts, sweet treats, etc. So these are the words that we are going to want 
to put in our **metadata** and throughout our site, where appropriate. 

.. note::
    Metadata is not visible on the frontend of the site, but it tells browsers and search engines important information
    about your site. 

Once you have your SEO strategy, you can begin adding it to your site in the CMS!

Adding Global SEO Settings to your site
---------------------------------------

For global SEO settings, go to **Settings > SEO**. This will take you to the SEO admin page.
