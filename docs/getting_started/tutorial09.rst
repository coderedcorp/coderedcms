Your First CodeRed Website: Part 9
==================================

The Media you add to your site in the CMS is an important part of your page design. Images catch people's eyes,
and good images make good impressions. Let's go over some ways that you can optimize your images for 
your CodeRed CMS website. 

Preparing your images for upload
--------------------------------

The CMS will accept the following file types for images:

* **GIF**

* **JPEG/JPG**

* **PNG**

* **WEBP**

If your image is not saved in any of these formats, you need to convert your image or save your image again
in one of these formats. 

The CMS also has a file size limitation. If your image file is exceeds **10.0 MB**, it will not be able to be uploaded.
You will need to decrease the file size. It's easy to do this: Just open your image editing program, like Photoshop or GIMP,
and change the size of the file. You can also use sites like `BeFunky <https://www.befunky.com/>`_ to re-size your images.
Make them smaller by changing the dimensions of the image.

In some cases, you may want to crop your image so that the part that you want to focus on is more in the frame. You will also
be able to specify a focal point in the CMS Image Editor, but sometimes it alone is not enough to get the focus or angle that 
you may need.

Ways to upload your images
--------------------------

While you have already practiced uploading images from within the page editors, you can also upload images another way.
Go to **Images** from the admin bar. There, you will be able to either drag and drop your images into the upload area, 
or upload them from your computer using the upload button. Use descriptive names and/or image tags for the images so 
that you can easily search for them and use them in your pages.

CMS editing tools for images
----------------------------

While the majority of your image editing should be done in an actual image editor, the CMS does provide some tools to help you
optimize your images for your site.

The title can either be the name of the image or a custom title. You can also add tags to your images for easy searching in the CMS.
The **Focal Point** is optional, but it defines the image's most important region. Move your cursor over the image while you see a + sign,
then release your cursor or mouse when you have finished defining the focal point.
