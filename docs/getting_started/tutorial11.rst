Tutorial Part 11: Password-Protected Pages
==========================================

Finally, let's talk about how to **password-protect** pages that you only want those with proper
permissions to be able to access when they visit the website. Maybe you want to hide a document page
for special bulk pricing or an information page for customers behind a password. There is an easy way to do this from within the CMS.

Navigate to the page that you want to add password-protection. (In this case "Bulk Sales") You need to either save it as a draft or publish
it before you can access the Password-Protect feature.  Go to the settings tab in the editing screen.

The default setting for **Privacy** is Public, which means that the page will be available to view for anyone
who comes to the website once it has been published. You can change this by clicking on the **Set page privacy** button and revealing the pop-up that
has more Privacy options, shown below.

    The Privacy options pop-up screen.

.. note::
    Any privacy setting that you set on a parent or landing page is applied to all of the child or sub-pages as well.

Select the level of privacy that you want.

* **Private, accessible to logged-in users**: Only available to those who are logged into the CMS

* **Private, accessible with the following password**: Only available from the frontend with a password that you set

* **Private, accessible to users in specific groups**: Only available to groups that you set in the CMS, like Moderators or Editors

For a simple way to protect content on your site from unauthorized readers, select **Private, accessible with the following password**
and choose a password. If the page doesn't contain any sensitive information, the password doesn't necessarily need to be
super-complex. Our password Password-Protected page.

but not sensitive, information.
