Deploying & Hosting Wagtail CRX
===============================

Wagtail CRX can be deployed and hosted just like any other Wagtail or Django website. Read the `Wagtail hosting guide <https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/deployment/index.html>`_.

CodeRed also provides `CodeRed Cloud, optimized for deploying and hosting wagtail sites <https://www.codered.cloud/docs/wagtail/quickstart/>`_, which includes both free and professional grade plans.
