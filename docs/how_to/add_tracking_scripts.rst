Add Tracking Scripts
====================

Tracking scripts, such as like Google Analytics or Facebook Pixels, can be added
to the ``<head>`` and ``<body>`` of all of your web pages.

Tracking settings are located in the Wagtail Admin dashboard under
**Settings > Tracking**.


Google Analytics
----------------

For Google Analytics, all you need is the **GA Tracking ID**. Copy and paste this ID into the field.
Then, if you want to track button clicks, just click the checkbox. Save and you're done!


Other Scripts
-------------

If you have other tracking codes to add, follow these steps:

#. In the Wagtail admin, go to **Settings > Tracking**.

#. The tracking scripts will usually give you instructions of where to place
   them. So, make sure to verify the instructions that were given to you.

#. Copy and paste scripts that should be between the ``<head>`` tags in the box
   labeled for ``<head>`` scripts.

#. Copy and paste scripts that should be toward the closing ``<body>`` tag in
   the box labeled for ``<body>`` scripts.

#. Click **Save** and you're done!
