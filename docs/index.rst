CodeRed CMS is a fully featured content management system for building marketing websites.
It aims to be general purpose and ready to use out of the box as a more professional and performant
alternative to WordPress.

Written in Python, and heavily based on `Wagtail <https://wagtail.io>`_,
it is extremely quick and easy to customize the website's design due to a responsive grid-based
editing interface and a pure Bootstrap 4 front-end. Features needed by marketing teams are also
built-in including proper SEO tagging, Google Analytics tracking, and publishing tools.
