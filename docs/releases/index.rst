Release Notes
=============

CodeRed CMS follows the ``[major].[minor].[maintenance]`` versioning scheme.

* **Major** - significant changes that may not be backwards compatible.
* **Minor** - new features, enhancements, and bug fixes that are most likely
  but not guaranteed to be backwards compatible.
* **Maintenance** - guaranteed to be backwards compatible. These changes are
  reserved for bug, security, or documentation fixes only.

.. note::
    CodeRed CMS may have breaking changes between minor version upgrades until reaching a stable
    1.0 status. Releases with a zero major version number are considered "beta" quality.
