CodeRed CMS 0.14.0 release notes
================================


New features
------------

* NEW page preview block enables selecting a single page anywhere in the streamfield
  and rendering a preview of that page using various templates including a Bootstrap
  card and an HTML form for FormPage types.
* NEW classifiers enable custom category/group functionality for pages. Create custom
  classifiers and orderable terms within each classifier. Then assign classifier terms
  to pages to enable filtering by specific classifier terms.
* The current page in a navbar or dropdown is highlighted using the ``active`` CSS class.
* The default streamfield on pages, resusable content snippets, footers, carousels, and modals
  now includes more blocks including the "Latest pages" and "Page preview" blocks.


Maintenance
-----------

* New projects created with ``coderedcms start`` include a ``.gitignore`` file that ignores
  editor files (VS Code, emacs, vim, sublime, pycharm, etc.) files by default.


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

* You will need to run ``python manage.py makemigrations website`` and ``python manage.py migrate`` after upgrading.
* Some blocks within coderedcms/blocks/content_blocks.py have been moved to coderedcms/blocks/html_blocks.py.
