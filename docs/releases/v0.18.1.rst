v0.18.1 release notes
=====================


Bug fixes
---------

* Custom CSS class and Custom ID set in StreamField blocks should now render
  correctly in HTML.
* Fix new flake8 code quality warning.


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

Many built-in HTML templates have changed, in order to reference the correct
block attribute (``self.settings.custom_id``) versus the incorrect
(``self.settings.custom_css_id`` or variations of that). If you are overring or
have copied any built-in HTML templates, please double check that you may need
to manually fix this bug in some of your own templates as well.
