CodeRed CMS 0.19.0 release notes
================================


Bug fixes
---------


New features
------------

* Upgraded to Bootstrap 4.5 and jQuery 3.5.1


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

* If you have overridden ``coderedcms/pages/base.html``, you may need to update
  references to ``jquery-3.4.1`` to ``jquery-3.5.1``.
* If using SASS, you may need to update your ``custom.scss`` or
  ``_variables.scss`` files accordingly to support Bootstrap 4.5. Or you may
  continue using Bootstrap 4.3 by `downloading a copy of the Bootstrap 4.3
  sources <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/download/>`_
  and changing the references in your ``custom.scss`` to use these files.
* You may need to run ``python manage.py makemigrations website`` and
  ``python manage.py migrate`` after upgrading.
