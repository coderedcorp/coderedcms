v0.20.0 release notes
=====================


Bug fixes
---------

* Fix rich text toolbar in Wagtail admin when scrolling long blocks of text.

* Always create valid element IDs in templates when random generation is
  required (i.e. modal blocks).

* Fix rendering of modal button to be valid HTML.


New features
------------

* Upgraded to Wagtail 2.11

* Upgraded to Bootstrap 4.6.0


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

* You may need to alter your initial ``website`` migration if you run into any
  issues after updating. See `Wagtail 2.11 release notes
  <https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/releases/2.11.html#run-before-declaration-needed-in-initial-homepage-migration>`_.

* If you have forms and form submissions in your database, you may need to add the ``unidecode`` library to your project's ``requirements.txt``.
  Wagtail 2.11 replaces ``unidecode`` with ``anyascii`` for Unicode to Ascii conversion. Your older form data will still need the ``unidecode`` library
  to be read by Wagtail. Read more in the `Wagtail 2.11 notes for other features <https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/releases/2.11.html#other-features>`_.
