v0.21.0 release notes
=====================


New features
------------

* Upgraded to Wagtail 2.13


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

* ``coderedcms.blocks.MultiSelectBlock`` has been removed and is now replaced
  with ``wagtail.core.blocks.MultipleChoiceBlock``.

* You may need to find/replace
  ``coderedcms.blocks.base_blocks.MultiSelectBlock`` with
  ``wagtail.core.blocks.MultipleChoiceBlock`` in any old migrations so that they
  may continue working.

* Follow `Wagtail 2.12 upgrade considerations <https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/releases/2.12.html#upgrade-considerations>`_
  and `Wagtail 2.13 upgrade considerations <https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/releases/2.13.html#upgrade-considerations>`_.

* You may need to run ``python manage.py makemigrations website`` and
  ``python manage.py migrate`` after upgrading.
