v0.22.0 release notes
=====================


New features
------------

* Upgraded to Wagtail 2.14

* Can now order child pages by Classifiers, using the Classifier Term's
  sort order, in addition to ordering by model attributes. Read details in
  :doc:`/features/page_types/web_pages`.

* Background behind site's logo shown in the Wagtail Admin now follows "Navbar
  color scheme" setting to improve appearance of dark logos.


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

* Wagtail 2.14 dropped Django 2.2 support. For most CodeRed CMS sites no changes
  are required.


Supported software
------------------

* Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9

* Django 3.0, 3.1, 3.2
