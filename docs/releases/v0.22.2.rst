v0.22.2 release notes
=====================


Bug fixes
---------

* Form submission email contents were empty and being attached in a text file.
  The contents are now in the email as expected (Bug was introduced in 0.22.0).

* Field labels in form submission emails now show the exact label as entered
  on the Wagtail page, instead of a "humanized" version of the field ID.

* Fix layout of fields in the Wagtail admin, which may appear centered instead
  of left-aligned under certain StreamField conditions.

* Regenerate initial migration file in project template, so that new projects
  are up to date with built-in models.
