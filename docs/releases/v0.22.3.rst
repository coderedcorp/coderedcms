v0.22.3 release notes
=====================


Bug fixes
---------

* Form submission emails were broken on custom form pages which override
  ``get_form_fields()`` and do not return fields as classes inheriting
  ``AbstractFormField`` (Bug was introduced in 0.22.2).

* Prevent upward path traversals outside of ``CODERED_PROTECTED_MEDIA_ROOT``
  when serving protected media files. This only applies to logged in users,
  anonymous users do not have permission to access this URL.
