Upgrade considerations

* Wagtail is now using a new search backend.

  * Specify the `new default in your settings <https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/releases/2.15.html#database-search-backends-replaced>`_.

  * Next, you will need to run the `update_index command <https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/management_commands.html#update-index>`_.

* Other upgrade considerations for `Wagtail 2.15 <https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/releases/2.15.html#upgrade-considerations>`_.

* Other upgrade considerations for `Wagtail 2.16 <https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/releases/2.16.html#upgrade-considerations>`_.

* Font Awesome (``wagtailfontawesome``) has been removed as a dependency. You
  should remove this from your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and/or ``requirements.txt``
  file (unless you are using it elsewhere in your code).
