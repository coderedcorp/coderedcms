v0.25.0 release notes
=====================


New features
------------

* Search now searches all Wagtail ``Page`` models. Previously it would only
  search models inheriting from ``CoderedPage``. Search has also been refactored
  in accordance with the new Wagtail search backends.

* Search page template has new blocks to facilitate extending and customizing
  the appearance. See ``templates/wagtailcrx/pages/search.html``.


Bug fixes
---------

* Validate POST and GET inputs on calendar/event ajax views. Spam bots posting
  invalid parameters would cause 500 server errors; instead this will now cause
  more appropriate 400/404 errors.


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

* ``search_db_*`` fields on page models have been removed in favor of native
  Wagtail search features. See :doc:`/features/searching`.
