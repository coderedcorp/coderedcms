v2.1.0 release notes
====================


New features
------------

* New snippet and block: :doc:`/features/snippets/filmstrip`.

* New system-wide feature: :doc:`/features/related_pages`.

* New template rendering option for page models, the "miniview". Instead of a full page template, this is used to render a small preview of the page in other places on the site, usually in a Bootstrap card format. The miniview template is used by:

  * :doc:`/features/related_pages`

  * :doc:`/features/blocks/contentblocks/pagepreview`

  * :doc:`/features/blocks/contentblocks/latestpages`


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

The built-in template options under Page Preview and Latest Pages block **Advanced Settings** are deprecated as of 2.1 and will be removed in 3.0. These have been replaced with identical miniview templates for Article and Form pages. **If you have overridden these templates** it is recommended to set your custom instead on the page model's ``miniview_template`` field.

The new related pages feature is on by default for any newly created pages based on ``CoderedArticlePage``.

* If you do not want this feature, disable it by setting ``related_show_default=False`` on your Article model.

* If you want this feature retroactively on existing pages, write a simple query or migration to turn it on for those pages:

  .. code-block:: python

     # To enable related pages on just Article pages:
     from website.models import ArticlePage
     ArticlePage.objects.all().update(related_show=True)

     # To enable related pages on all pages of the site:
     from coderedcms.models import CoderedPage
     CoderedPage.objects.all().update(related_show=True)

As always, be sure to make and apply migrations after upgrading:

.. code-block:: text

   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
