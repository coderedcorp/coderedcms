v3.0.3 release notes
====================


Bug fixes
---------

* Support Django 5, which was added in Wagtail 5.2.2.

* Support SVG images.

* Fix bug that happens when ordering child pages by Classifier, if a child page contains multiple ClassifierTerms belonging to that Classifier.

Upgrade considerations
----------------------

* As described in the `Wagtail documentation <https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/topics/images.html#id8>`_, enabling SVG support requires adding the following to the Django settings file: ``WAGTAILIMAGES_EXTENSIONS = ["gif", "jpg", "jpeg", "png", "webp", "svg"]``.
