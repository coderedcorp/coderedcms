v4.0.1 release notes
====================


Bug fixes
---------

* Fix site name on login screen (bug introduced in 4.0).

Changes
-------

* Use favicon instead of logo in Wagtail Admin. Starting with 4.0, sites with navbar settings disabled do not have the ability to change the light/dark navbar setting, which was being used in the admin to put a light or dark background on the logo. Because if this, a white logo on the default light background is unreadable. Determining if the logo is light or dark was a perpetual problem. To simplify it, we've switched to using the favicon. The favicon is much more suitable for this kind of situation.
